                <h2>People Matter.</h2>
                <p>From that person filling your coffee in the morning to the folks who stocked the shelves at the grocery store, thousands of working Americans are doing what they can to bring food to their tables.</p>  
                <p>See some of the ways you can power up the workers in your community below, by giving your tip!</p>

                        <h3>Stocking Shelves Sounds Easy...</h3>
                        <p>...but deciding what to put on the shelves is another matter entirely.  Food retailers operate on slim margins, even slimmer now with the all-out price-wars going on amongst all the major players.  Supermarket employees are worked very hard, and often treated very poorly, by management and customers alike.  Make someone's day, and make up for those lost thank-you's by giving a tip!</p>

                        <h3>Do you trust your Valet..?</h3>
                        <p>...handing over those keys when you're in a hurry can be the ultimate convenience, but remember that the valet is paid like they are doing nothing all day.  Don't expect a hurry up without compensating your person fairly. Make someone's day, and reward that hustle by giving a tip!</p>

                        <h3>The last mile is always the hardest...</h3>
                        <p>...meaning, your box never magically arrives on your doorstep.  It's a team effort of hundreds of people, but most importantly, the person who places the box at your doorstep.  Drivers have to keep tight schedules, and sit in traffic for a long time every day.   Ensure your parcel's safe delivery and feel good by giving a tip!</p>

                        <h3>Below Minimum Wage...</h3>
                        <p>...that's the hourly pay of many waiters and waitresses.  Even today, in 2019, restaurants pay waitstaff $3-4 less than the state's minimum hourly wage.  Their work isn't worthless, and they deserve a living wage as well.  Make sure your waiter can afford food, and reward anything extra by tipping superfluously!</p>
