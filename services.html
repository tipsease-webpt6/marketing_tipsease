                <p>From that person filling your coffee in the morning to the folks who stocked the shelves at the grocery store, thousands of working Americans are doing what they can to bring food to their tables.</p>  
                <p>See some of the ways you can power up the workers in your community below, by giving your tip!</p>

                        <p>...but deciding what to put on the shelves is another matter entirely.  Food retailers operate on slim margins, even slimmer now with the all-out price-wars going on amongst all the major players.  Supermarket employees are worked very hard, and often treated very poorly, by management and customers alike.  Make someone's day, and make up for those lost thank-you's by giving a tip!</p>
